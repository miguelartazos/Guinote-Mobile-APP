# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 successfully implemented comprehensive online multiplayer functionality for the Guiñote card game using Supabase for the backend and Clerk for authentication.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Infrastructure

#### Schema Design
- **8 Core Tables**: profiles, rooms, room_players, game_moves, friendships, friend_invites, matchmaking_queue, game_statistics
- **3 Database Functions**: generate_room_code(), update_room_player_count(), cleanup_abandoned_rooms()
- **Comprehensive RLS Policies**: Secure multi-tenant access with row-level security

#### Key Features
- 6-character unique room codes for easy game joining
- Automatic player count updates via triggers
- Abandoned room cleanup for resource optimization
- JSON game state storage with TypeScript type safety

### 2. Authentication System

#### Clerk Integration
- Phone number authentication with SMS
- Google OAuth support
- JWT template for Supabase integration
- Secure token storage with Expo SecureStore
- Profile synchronization between Clerk and Supabase

### 3. Room Management

#### Room Service (`src/services/room/roomService.ts`)
- Create public/private rooms
- Join rooms with validation
- Leave rooms with host transfer
- Start games with ready check
- Bot player support

#### Features
- Real-time player count updates
- Host migration when host leaves
- Room status management (waiting, playing, finished)
- Public room discovery

### 4. Matchmaking System

#### Matchmaking Service (`src/services/matchmaking/matchmakingService.ts`)
- Quick match with ranking-based pairing
- Progressive tolerance expansion
- Automatic room creation
- AI player filling after timeout
- Real-time match notifications

#### Algorithm
- Initial ranking tolerance: ±100 points
- Expands by 100 points per attempt
- Maximum 5 search attempts
- Creates new room if no match found
- Fills with AI after 15 seconds

### 5. Real-time Game Synchronization

#### Real-time Hook (`src/hooks/useRealtimeGame.ts`)
- Supabase channel subscriptions
- Game state synchronization
- Player presence tracking
- Move broadcasting
- Connection status monitoring

#### Optimizations
- Optimistic move updates
- Offline move queueing
- Automatic reconnection
- State reconciliation

### 6. Friend System

#### Friend Service (`src/services/friends/friendService.ts`)
- Send/accept/decline friend invites
- Friend list management
- Online status tracking
- Friend game invitations
- Block/unblock functionality

### 7. UI Components

#### New Screens
- **OnlineLobbyScreen**: Tabbed interface for matchmaking, rooms, and friends
- **NetworkGameScreen**: Wrapper for online games with connection status
- **LoginScreen/RegisterScreen**: Authentication flows
- **ConnectionStatus**: Visual connection indicator

#### Enhanced Components
- Room creation modal
- Player ready indicators
- Matchmaking queue display
- Friend list with online status

### 8. Game Engine Updates

#### New Utilities
- `applyGameMove()`: Validates and applies moves
- `isValidMove()`: Move validation
- `getValidMoves()`: Available moves for AI
- `continueFromScoring()`: Handles game flow after scoring

#### Move Types
- play_card
- cambiar_7
- declare_cante
- declare_victory

### 9. Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Coverage
- 17 room service tests
- 10 matchmaking tests
- Friend system tests
- Game engine tests
- Mock Supabase client setup

#### Test Utilities
- Fluent API mocking for Supabase
- Fake timers for async testing
- Comprehensive test fixtures

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices

1. **Supabase over Firebase**
   - PostgreSQL for complex queries
   - Built-in RLS for security
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Open source

2. **Clerk for Authentication**
   - Native phone auth support
   - Easy social login integration
   - JWT customization
   - React Native SDK

3. **Optimistic Updates**
   - Better UX for online play
   - Rollback on server rejection
   - Offline queue for resilience

4. **TypeScript Branded Types**
   - Type safety for IDs
   - Prevents mixing ID types
   - Better IDE support

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Connection Management**
   - Single Supabase client instance
   - Channel reuse for subscriptions
   - Presence updates every 30 seconds

2. **State Management**
   - Local state for immediate updates
   - Server state as source of truth
   - Minimal re-renders with selective updates

3. **Database Queries**
   - Indexed columns for matchmaking
   - Composite queries for room finding
   - Batch updates where possible

## Security Measures

1. **Row Level Security**
   - Users can only modify their own data
   - Room access requires being a player
   - Friend invites require mutual consent

2. **Input Validation**
   - Move validation before applying
   - Room capacity checks
   - Ranking verification

3. **JWT Security**
   - Clerk signs JWTs
   - Supabase verifies signatures
   - Short token lifetimes

## Known Limitations

1. **Scalability**
   - Real-time connections limited by Supabase plan
   - Matchmaking may slow with many players
   - No geographic region support yet

2. **Features**
   - No spectator mode
   - No tournament support
   - No replay system
   - Voice chat not implemented

## Future Enhancements

1. **Phase 3 Possibilities**
   - Tournament system
   - Spectator mode
   - Voice chat integration
   - Advanced statistics
   - Achievements system
   - Push notifications

2. **Performance**
   - WebSocket connection pooling
   - State compression
   - Predictive preloading
   - CDN for assets

## Migration Notes

### From Phase 1 to Phase 2

1. **No Breaking Changes**
   - Offline mode still works
   - AI players enhanced but compatible
   - Local multiplayer unchanged

2. **New Dependencies**
   ```json
   "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.x",
   "@clerk/clerk-expo": "^1.x",
   "expo-secure-store": "*"
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Must set Supabase credentials
   - Must set Clerk publishable key
   - Optional API timeout configuration

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully transforms the Guiñote game from a local-only experience to a full-featured online multiplayer game. The implementation follows best practices for security, performance, and user experience while maintaining the core game mechanics established in Phase 1.
