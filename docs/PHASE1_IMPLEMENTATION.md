# Phase 1: Multiplayer Foundation Implementation

## Summary

Phase 1 of the multiplayer implementation has been completed. This phase established the foundation for online multiplayer support while maintaining full backwards compatibility with offline mode.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Authentication Setup ✅
- **Clerk Integration**: Added `@clerk/clerk-expo` for authentication UI
- **Auth Provider**: Created `ClerkAuthProvider` wrapper component
- **Auth Hook**: Implemented `useClerkAuth` with:
  - Phone number sign-in/sign-up with SMS OTP
  - Google OAuth support
  - Automatic Supabase profile syncing
  - Spanish localization support

### 2. Game State Serialization ✅
- **Serialization Adapter**: Created `gameStateAdapter.ts` to convert between:
  - Runtime GameState (with Maps, functions, non-serializable types)
  - SerializedGameState (JSON-compatible for database storage)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper conversions
- **Validation**: Includes validation function to ensure lossless conversion

### 3. Pure Game Logic ✅
- **Game Engine**: Created `gameEngine.ts` with pure functions:
  - `applyGameMove()`: Apply any game move to create new state
  - `applyPlayCard()`, `applyCantar()`, `applyCambiar7()`, etc.
  - No side effects, fully testable
- **Move Types**: Defined `GameMove` union type for all possible actions
- **Move Validation**: Separated validation logic in `gameMoveValidation.ts`

### 4. Network-Aware Game Hook ✅
- **Hybrid Hook**: Created `useNetworkGameState` that:
  - Falls back to offline `useGameState` for offline/local modes
  - Uses real-time synchronization for online mode
  - Implements optimistic updates with rollback
  - Queues moves when disconnected
  - Handles reconnection gracefully

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
```
UI Layer (React State)
    ↕️
Game Logic Layer (Pure Functions)
    ↕️
Network Layer (Supabase Real-time)
```

### Key Patterns
1. **Optimistic Updates**: Apply moves locally first, rollback on server rejection
2. **Move Queue**: Store moves when offline, replay when reconnected
3. **Pure Functions**: All game logic is pure for easy testing and predictability
4. **Type Safety**: Branded types prevent mixing IDs, full TypeScript coverage

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/src/providers/ClerkAuthProvider.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useClerkAuth.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useNetworkGameState.ts`
- `/src/utils/gameEngine.ts`
- `/src/utils/gameStateAdapter.ts`
- `/src/utils/gameMoveValidation.ts`
- `/src/types/gameMove.types.ts`

### Modified Files
- `/src/types/game.types.ts` - Added GameMove export
- `/src/hooks/useRealtimeGame.ts` - Updated import

## Testing

All existing game logic tests continue to pass:
- 43 tests passing in `gameLogic.spec.ts`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will implement:
1. Clerk authentication UI screens
2. Real-time game state synchronization
3. Room creation and joining
4. Player presence tracking
5. Move broadcasting

## Usage Example

```typescript
// For offline mode (unchanged)
const gameHook = useNetworkGameState({
  gameMode: 'offline',
  playerName: 'Juan',
  difficulty: 'medium'
});

// For online mode (new)
const gameHook = useNetworkGameState({
  gameMode: 'online',
  roomId: 'ABC123',
  userId: 'user_123',
  playerName: 'Juan'
});

// All game actions work the same
gameHook.playCard(cardId);
gameHook.cantar('oros');
```

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@clerk/clerk-expo": "^2.14.14",
  "expo-constants": "^17.1.7",
  "expo-secure-store": "^14.2.3"
}
```

## Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
```

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes
- Offline mode continues to work exactly as before
- Online features are opt-in via `gameMode` parameter
- All existing tests pass without modification
