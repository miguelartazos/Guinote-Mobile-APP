# MCP Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

All conflicting MCP servers have been disabled, keeping only those that complement Claude Code's built-in tools.

## Actions Taken

### 1. **Killed Running MCP Processes** ✅
- Terminated all running MCP server processes
- Verified no MCP processes are running

### 2. **Backed Up Original Configuration** ✅
- Created backup: `.mcp.json.backup-20250819-203024`
- Original configuration preserved for rollback if needed

### 3. **Updated MCP Configuration** ✅
- Reduced from 10 MCP servers to 4 non-conflicting servers
- Removed all MCPs that duplicate Claude Code functionality

### 4. **Created Documentation** ✅
- `MCP_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` - Detailed conflict analysis
- `MCP_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
- `scripts/setup-mcp-minimal.sh` - New setup script for minimal config

### 5. **Deprecated Old Scripts** ✅
- Added deprecation warnings to `scripts/setup-mcp.sh`
- Added deprecation warnings to `scripts/enable-mcp.sh`

## Final Configuration

### Removed MCPs (Conflicting):
- ❌ **filesystem** → Use Claude Code's Read/Write/Edit tools
- ❌ **terminal** → Use Claude Code's Bash tool
- ❌ **git** → Use git commands via Bash tool
- ❌ **github** → Use gh CLI via Bash tool
- ❌ **sentry** → No official MCP exists, use SDK
- ❌ **expo** → No official MCP exists, use CLI
- ❌ **convex** → No official MCP exists, use SDK

### Retained MCPs (Non-Conflicting):
- ✅ **jest** - Specialized test runner integration
- ✅ **eslint** - Advanced linting with auto-fix
- ✅ **prettier** - Code formatting with config awareness
- ✅ **supabase** - Database management API

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated Conflicts**: No more duplicate functionality between MCPs and Claude Code
2. **Improved Performance**: Reduced resource usage from fewer processes
3. **Clearer Architecture**: Each tool has a distinct purpose
4. **Better Maintainability**: Simpler configuration to manage

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new configuration
2. **Use the new workflow**:
   - File operations → Claude Code's built-in tools
   - Terminal commands → Claude Code's Bash tool
   - Git/GitHub → Bash tool with git/gh commands
   - Testing/Linting → Retained MCP servers

## Quick Reference

| Task | Old Method | New Method |
|------|------------|------------|
| Read file | filesystem MCP | Claude Code's Read tool |
| Edit file | filesystem MCP | Claude Code's Edit tool |
| Run command | terminal MCP | Claude Code's Bash tool |
| Git operations | git MCP | `git` via Bash tool |
| GitHub PRs | github MCP | `gh` via Bash tool |
| Run tests | jest MCP | jest MCP (kept) |
| Format code | prettier MCP | prettier MCP (kept) |

## Files Modified

- `.mcp.json` - Reduced to 4 non-conflicting servers
- `scripts/setup-mcp-minimal.sh` - New minimal setup script
- `scripts/setup-mcp.sh` - Added deprecation warning
- `scripts/enable-mcp.sh` - Added deprecation warning
- `MCP_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` - Detailed documentation
- `MCP_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Verification

The configuration has been validated:
- ✅ JSON syntax is valid
- ✅ No MCP processes running
- ✅ Backup created successfully
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Code formatted with prettier

## Notes

- TypeScript and ESLint errors found are pre-existing and unrelated to MCP changes
- The original configuration is backed up and can be restored if needed
- The new configuration follows best practices for Claude Code integration
