# üéÆ MULTIPLAYER IMPLEMENTATION TRACKER

## ‚ö° QUICK START FOR CLAUDE CODE

When starting a new session, Claude Code should:
1. **READ THIS FILE FIRST** to understand current progress
2. Check which tickets are ‚úÖ DONE vs ‚è≥ PENDING
3. Read implementation notes from completed tickets
4. Continue with next pending ticket in sequence
5. **UPDATE THIS FILE** after completing each ticket

## üìä PROGRESS OVERVIEW

**Current Sprint**: SPRINT 5
**Completed Tickets**: 9/13
**Hermes Safe**: ‚úÖ YES - No Supabase imports at startup when flag is OFF
**Feature Flag Status**: OFF (enableMultiplayer: false)

---

## üéØ SPRINT 1: FOUNDATION (Days 1-3)
*Offline-first hooks with safe boundaries*

### üìå Ticket 1: Feature Flag + Safe Import Boundary
**Status**: ‚úÖ DONE
**Completed**: 2025-08-31
**Dependencies**: None
**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/config/featureFlags.ts` (updated existing)
- `src/services/realtimeClient.native.ts` (new)
- `src/hooks/useMultiplayerGame.ts` (new)
- `src/providers/SupabaseLifecycleProvider.tsx` (updated)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] App boots with flag OFF, zero Supabase imports at startup
- [x] Enabling flag activates realtime without reload
- [x] All multiplayer code behind flag check

**Implementation Notes**:
```
- Added master `enableMultiplayer` flag (OFF by default) to existing feature flag system
- Created safe lazy-loading wrapper in realtimeClient.native.ts
- useMultiplayerGame hook returns offline-safe defaults when disabled
- Updated SupabaseLifecycleProvider to use master flag
- All tests passing (13/13 feature flag tests)
- Hermes safety verified - no Supabase imports when flag is OFF
- Key decision: Reused existing feature flag manager with AsyncStorage
- Deviation: Updated existing featureFlags.ts instead of creating new one
- Next ticket should know: Master flag controls all Supabase features

TECH DEBT IDENTIFIED (from code review):
1. Type Safety: useMultiplayerGame uses `any` types for action and presenceState
   - Line 178: sendGameAction(action: any) should be typed
   - Line 226: presenceState: any should have proper type
2. Missing Tests: No unit tests for useMultiplayerGame hook
3. Error Recovery: No retry logic in createRealtimeClient if import fails

These issues don't block functionality but should be addressed in future tickets.
```

  - Reused existing RLS patterns with DO $$ blocks
  - Used auth.uid() through users table join for consistency
- Deviations from original spec:
  - Simplified to match existing migration style
  - Did not add get_online_friends function (mentioned in ticket 3 but not required here)
- Next ticket should know:
  - Migration ready to apply to database
  - All operations are safe to run multiple times

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT

### Core Principles
1. **Offline-first**: All features work offline, sync when online
2. **Hermes-safe**: No Supabase imports at startup, feature-flagged
3. **Server authority**: Server validates all moves, single source of truth
4. **Deterministic AI**: Room-seeded RNG for consistent behavior

### Architecture Decisions
- **Hooks**: `useUnifiedRooms`, `useUnifiedFriends` for state management
- **Queue System**: Actions queued offline, executed on reconnect
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate updates with rollback on server rejection
- **Version Control**: State versioning to prevent divergence

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each hook and service
- Integration tests for realtime flows
- Maestro tests for UI flows
- Network interruption testing
